## My Workout App

The purpose of this application is to allow a user to log workout data, daily weight, and daily calories on their phone.

---

### Log-in/Register

The purpose of accounts for this app, is to separate locally stored data between different users. Cloud synchronization was not implemented for user data.

### Create Exercise

Users can only store data for exercises that are pre-created. This way the user doesnt have to type in the exercise name every time.

> 2. For Logging Weight, the user enters their weight and clicks submit.
> 3. For Logging Calories, the user enters an amount of calories and can either add or subtract it from the daily value.
